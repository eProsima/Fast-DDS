This document is a declaration of software quality for *eprosima Fast DDS* inspired on the guidelines provided in the [ROS 2 REP-2004 document](https://www.ros.org/reps/rep-2004.html).

Quality Declaration
=============================

*eprosima Fast DDS* (formerly Fast RTPS) is a C++ implementation of the DDS (Data Distribution Service) standard of the OMG (Object Management Group).
eProsima Fast DDS implements the RTPS (Real Time Publish Subscribe) protocol, which provides publisher-subscriber communications over unreliable transports such as UDP,
as defined and maintained by the Object Management Group (OMG) consortium.

New features are required to have tests before being added as stated in [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/eProsima/policies/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
Current nightly results can be found here:

* Linux [![Linux ci](http://jenkins.eprosima.com:8080/job/nightly_fastdds_sec_master_linux/badge/icon?subject=%20%20%20Linux%20CI%20)](http://jenkins.eprosima.com:8080/job/nightly_fastdds_sec_master_linux)
* Linux-aarch64 [![Linux arm64 ci](http://jenkins.eprosima.com:8080/job/nightly_fastdds_sec_master_linux_aarch64/badge/icon?subject=%20%20%20Linux-aarch64%20CI%20)](http://jenkins.eprosima.com:8080/view/Nightly/job/nightly_fastdds_sec_master_linux_aarch64/)
* Windows [![Windows ci](http://jenkins.eprosima.com:8080/job/nightly_fastdds_sec_master_windows/label=windows-secure,platform=x64,toolset=v141/badge/icon?subject=%20%20%20%20Windows%20CI%20)](http://jenkins.eprosima.com:8080/job/nightly_fastdds_sec_master_windows/label=windows-secure,platform=x64,toolset=v141)

### Public API Testing [4.ii]

Each part of the public API has tests, and new additions or changes to the public API require tests before being added.
The tests aim to cover typical usage. Currently, efforts are being made to improve our code coverage statistics in order to test corner cases.

### Coverage [4.iii]

*eprosima Fast DDS* coverage reports can be accessed from the CI nightly results. These reports provide statistics of line and conditional coverage.

* [Linux Coverage Report](http://jenkins.eprosima.com:8080/job/nightly_fastdds_sec_master_linux/cobertura)
* [Mac Coverage Report](http://jenkins.eprosima.com:8080/job/nightly_fastdds_sec_master_mac/cobertura)

Changes are required to make a best effort to keep or increase coverage before being accepted, but decreases are allowed if properly justified and accepted by maintainers.

### Performance [4.iv]

*eprosima Fast DDS* provides a test directory specifically dedicated to performance that can be found [here](test/performance).
Performace tests are automatically run after merging to the master branch of the project.
If there has been any performance regression a notification is issued to maintainers that will study and decide how to proceed.

Latest latency performance test results can be accesed [here](http://jenkins.eprosima.com:8080/job/FastRTPS_latency_performance/lastBuild/) and latest throughput performance test results can be seen [here](http://jenkins.eprosima.com:8080/job/fastrtps_throughput_performance/lastBuild/).

Furthermore, [*eprosima benchmarking* project](https://github.com/eProsima/benchmarking) provides tools to run performance tests and a methodology to analyze and present the results:

* [Latency Performance Test Specification](https://github.com/eProsima/benchmarking/blob/master/fastrtps_automated_benchmark/latency/README.md)
* [Throughput Performance Test Specification](https://github.com/eProsima/benchmarking/blob/master/fastrtps_automated_benchmark/throughput/README.md)

### Linters and Static Analysis [4.v]

*eprosima Fast DDS* has a [code style](https://github.com/eProsima/cpp-style) that is enforced using [*uncrustify*](https://github.com/uncrustify/uncrustify).
Among the CI tests there are tests that ensures that every pull request is compliant with the code style.
The latest pull request results can be seen [here](http://jenkins.eprosima.com:8080/job/fastdds_github_uncrustify/lastBuild).
The tests only check files where changes have been made.
Therefore, the code style is only enforced in some files.
However, the tendency will be to homogenize the older source files to the code style.

*eprosima Fast DDS* uses Synopsis Coverity static code analysis and the latest results can be found [here](https://scan.coverity.com/projects/eprosima-fast-dds).

## Dependencies [5]

### Direct Runtime Dependencies [5.iii]

*eprosima Fast DDS* depends on the following packages:

- `libasio-dev`
- `libtinyxml2-dev`
- `fast-cdr`
- `foonathan_memory`

The first two dependencies are suggested to be installed for Linux using apt package manager, which would pull them from the Debian upstream.
Therefore, these dependencies can be considered Quality Level 1 following the [advantages of being packaged for Debian](https://wiki.debian.org/AdvantagesForUpstream).

**eProsima Fast CDR** Quality Declaration can be found [here](https://github.com/eProsima/Fast-CDR/blob/master/QUALITY.md). Currently, **eProsima Fast CDR** claims to be in the **Quality Level 2** category.

`foonathan_memory` Quality Declaration can be found [here](Quality_Declaration_foonathan_memory.md).
This declaration claims that, even though `foonathan_memory` does not meet several quality requirements, it is considered to fulfill the **Quality Level 2** requirements for its use within *eprosima Fast DDS* with the caveats explained in the declaration.

Therefore, *eprosima Fast DDS* currently could claim to be **Quality Level 2** at most.

## Platform Support [6]

*eprosima Fast DDS* supports the following platforms and tests each change against all of them as can be seen in the current nightly results:

* Linux [![Linux ci](http://jenkins.eprosima.com:8080/job/nightly_fastdds_sec_master_linux/badge/icon?subject=%20%20%20Linux%20CI%20)](http://jenkins.eprosima.com:8080/job/nightly_fastdds_sec_master_linux)
