# Release support

Please, refer to the [master branch](https://github.com/eProsima/Fast-DDS/blob/master/RELEASE_SUPPORT.md) for the latest
version of this document.

*eProsima Fast DDS* maintains several releases with different support cycles.
Major releases are scarce and they are made when public API is broken.
Latest major release is v2.0.0 (June 2020) which introduced DDS compliant API.

Each quarter, a new Fast DDS minor version is released, including new features.
By default, *eProsima Fast DDS* minor releases have a lifecycle of 6 months.
However, the life of certain branches can be extended depending on costumer needs.
Within the support period of any minor version, there can be patch releases that either add new fuctionalities in an
ABI compatible way, or fix possible issues.
Before the minor release end of life (EOL), a final patch release including the latest fixes will be done if there are
changes not included previously in any other patch release.

The table below outlines the *eProsima Fast DDS* minor releases and their support cycles:
