# Macro to find cmake built thirdparty libraries.
#
# Arguments:
#   :package: The name of the packge to find. Used for find_package(${package})
#   :extra arguments: Arguments passed after ${package} are parsed with cmake_parse_arguments()
#
# Related CMake options:
#   :THIRDPARTY: Activate the use of internal thirdparties [Defaults: OFF]. Set to ON if EPROSIMA_BUILD is set to ON.
#        Possible values:
#            * ON -> Use submodules only if package is not found elsewhere in the system.
#            * OFF -> Do not use submodules.
#            * FORCE -> Force the use submodules regarless of what is installed in the system.
#   :THIRDPARTY_${package}: Specialization of THIRDPARTY for a specific ${package}. Same possibilities as THIRDPARTY.
#        Unless specified otherwise, it has the same value as THIRDPARTY. Its value has preference over that of
#        THIRDPARTY.
#   :THIRDPARTY_UPDATE: Activate the auto-update of internal thirdparties [Defaults: ON]. Possible values: ON/OFF.
#
# The macro's procedure is as follows:
#   1. Try to find the package with find_package.
#         1.1. This step is not taken if THIRDPARTY_${package} is set to FORCE. This happens when the user specifically
#              sets THIRDPARTY_${package} to FORCE, or when THIRDPARTY is set to FORCE and THIRDPARTY_${package} is
#              unspecified (which means it takes the value of THIRDPARTY).
#         1.2. This step is not taken for the case of windows installer. That is if EPROSIMA_INSTALLER is set to ON.
#   2. If the package is not found in 1), and at least one of THIRDPARTY, THIRDPARTY_${package} is set
#      to ON or FORCE, use the thirdparty version.
#         2.1. If THIRDPARTY_UPDATE is set to ON, then update the corresponding git submodule.
#         2.2. Add the subdirectory /thirdparty/${package}.
#         2.3. Set ${package}_FOUND to TRUE.
#   3. If the package was not found anywhere, then print a WARNING or FATAL_ERROR message depending on whether the
#      package was required.
