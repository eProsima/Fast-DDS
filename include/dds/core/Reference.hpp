/**
 * @brief
 * Base class for reference-counted objects.
 *
 * All objects that have a reference-type have an associated shallow (polymorphic)
 * assignment operator that simply changes the value of the reference.
 * Furthermore, reference-types are safe, meaning that under no circumstances can
 * a reference point to an invalid object.
 * At any single point in time a reference can either refer to the null object or
 * to a valid object.
 *
 * The semantics for Reference types is defined by the DDS-PSM-Cxx class
 * dds::core::Reference. In the context of this specification the semantics implied
 * by the ReferenceType is mandatory, yet the implementation supplied as part of
 * this standard is provided to show one possible way of implementing this semantics.
 *
 * List of reference types:
 *
 * * Entity
 * * Condition
 * * GuardCondition
 * * ReadCondition
 * * QueryCondition
 * * Waitset
 * * DomainParticipant
 * * AnyDataWriter
 * * Publisher
 * * DataWriter
 * * AnyDataReader
 * * Subscriber
 * * DataReader
 * * SharedSamples
 * * AnyTopic
 * * Topic
 *
 * Instances of reference types are created using C++ constructors.
 * The trivial constructor is not defined for reference types; the only
 * alternative to properly constructing a reference is to initialize it to a
 * null reference by assigning dds::core::null.
 *
 * Resource management for some reference types might involve relatively
 * heavyweight operating-system resources (such as threads, mutexes,
 * and network sockets) in addition to memory.
 * These objects therefore provide a function close() that shall halt network
 * communication (in the case of entities) and dispose of any appropriate
 * operating-system resources.
 *
 * Users of this PSM are recommended to call close on objects of all reference
 * types once they are finished using them. In addition, implementations may
 * automatically close objects that they deem to be no longer in use,
 * subject to the following restrictions:
 *
 * * Any object to which the application has a direct reference
 *   (not including a WeakReference) is still in use.
 *
 * * Any object that has been explicitly retained is still in use.
 *
 * * The creator of any object that is still in use is itself still in use.
