/*
 * There are two parts in the IsoCpp API:
 *   - Specification API (include/dds)
 *   - Proprietary API   (include/org)
 * However, include/org mostly contains implementation details and only a small
 * part is API for the application.
 *
 * There are basically two ways of including the proprietary API into the API
 * documentation generated by doxygen.
 *
 * 1) Add include/org to the doxygen input directories and filter out the
 *    non-API information (see doxygen_isocpp2_*.cfg files)
 *      Advantage -
 *          Documentation is at the same place as the implementation.
 *      Disadvantage -
 *          The non-API filtering can be done by either changing the doxygen
 *          config files or adding cond/endcond tags all through the header
 *          files. Both will be quite cumbersome.
 * 2) Add a header file to include/dds that contains the documentation for the
 *    proprietary part of the API.
 *      Advantage -
 *          Simple.
 *      Disadvantage -
 *          Documentation is in a different place as the implementation.
 *
 * Option 2 is choosen (obviously, because you're looking at that actual
 * proprietary API documentation file).
