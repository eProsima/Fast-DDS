/**
 * @brief
 * A WaitSet object allows an application to wait until one or more of
 * the attached Condition objects has a trigger_value of TRUE or else
 * until the timeout expires.
 *
 * A WaitSet is not necessarily associated with a single DomainParticipant
 * and could be used to wait for Condition objects associated with different
 * DomainParticipant objects.
 *
 * @anchor anchor_dds_core_cond_waitset_examples
 * <b><i>Example with wait()</i></b><br>
 * When using the wait() operation, the triggered Conditions are returned in a list.
 * @code{.cpp}
 * // Create a Condition to attach to a Waitset
 * dds::core::cond::StatusCondition readerSC = dds::core::cond::StatusCondition(reader);
 * readerSC.enabled_statuses(dds::core::status::StatusMask::data_available());
 *
 * // Create WaitSet and attach Condition
 * dds::core::cond::WaitSet waitset;
 * waitset.attach_condition(readerSC); // or waitset += readerSC;
 *
 * dds::core::cond::WaitSet::ConditionSeq conditions;
 * while(true) {
 *     // Wait for any Condition to trigger.
 *     conditions = waitset.wait();
 *
 *     // Loop through the triggered conditions.
 *     for (int i=0; i < conditions.size(); i++) {
 *         // Handle data_available when right Condition triggered.
 *         if (conditions[i] == readerSC) {
 *             // Read samples from the DataReader
 *         }
 *     }
 * }
 * @endcode

 * <b><i>Example with dispatch()</i></b><br>
 * When using the dispatch() operation, the Functors of the triggered Conditions
 * will be called.
 * @code{.cpp}
 * // Functor to add to a Condition
 * class FunctorStatusCondition {
 * public:
 *     void operator()(const dds::core::cond::StatusCondition& condition) {
 *         // Possibly get reader from the condition and read some samples.
 *     }
 * };
 * FunctorStatusCondition functor;
 *
 * // Create a Condition with functor to attach to a Waitset
 * dds::core::cond::StatusCondition readerSC = dds::core::cond::StatusCondition(reader, functor);
 * readerSC.enabled_statuses(dds::core::status::StatusMask::data_available());
 *
 * // Create WaitSet and attach Condition
 * dds::core::cond::WaitSet waitset;
 * waitset.attach_condition(readerSC); // or waitset += readerSC;
 *
 * while(true) {
 *     // Wait for any Condition to trigger.
 *     // The functors of the Conditions are automatically called
 *     // when the Condition triggers.
 *     waitset.dispatch();
 * }
 * @endcode
