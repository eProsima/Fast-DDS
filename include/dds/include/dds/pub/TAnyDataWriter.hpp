 * @brief
 * Typeless base class for the typed DataWriter.
 *
 * DataWriters are created type specific (fi DataWriter<Foo::Bar> writer). However, there
 * are many places in the API (and possibly application) where the type can not be known
 * while still some DataWriter has to be passed around, stored or even typeless functionality
 * called.<br>
 * Main examples in the API that need typeless DataWriter are: Publisher, PublisherListener
 * and DomainParticipantListener.

     * Be aware that in case the operation returns normally, the data has only been
     * acknowledged by the local infrastructure: it does not mean all remote subscriptions
     * have already received the data. However, delivering the data to remote nodes is then
     * the sole responsibility of the networking service: even when the publishing
     * application would terminate, all data that has not yet been received may be
     * considered ‘on-route’ and will therefore eventually arrive (unless the networking
     * service itself will crash). In contrast, if a DataWriter would still have data in it’s
     * local history buffer when it terminates, this data is considered ‘lost’.

     * This operation is intended to be used only if one or more of the contained
     * DataWriters has its ReliabilityQosPolicyKind set to RELIABLE.
