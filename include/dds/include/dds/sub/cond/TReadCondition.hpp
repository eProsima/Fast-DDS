/**
 * @brief
 * ReadCondition objects are conditions specifically dedicated
 * to read operations and attached to one DataReader.
 *
 * ReadCondition objects allow an application to specify the data samples
 * it is interested in (by specifying the desired sample states, view states,
 * and instance states). (See the parameter definitions for DataReader's
 * read/take operations.) This allows the middle-ware to enable the condition
 * only when suitable information is available. They are to be used in
 * conjunction with a WaitSet as normal conditions. More than one
 * ReadCondition may be attached to the same DataReader.
 *
 * See the @ref anchor_dds_core_cond_waitset_examples "WaitSet examples" for some examples.<br>
 * Although the WaitSet examples use the StatusCondition, the basic usage of this Condition
 * with a WaitSet is the same.
 *
 * @see dds::core::cond::Condition
 * @see @ref DCPS_Modules_Infrastructure_Status  "Status concept"
