/**
 * @brief
 * DataWriter allows the application to set the value of the sample to be published
 * under a given Topic.
 *
 * A DataWriter is attached to exactly one Publisher.
 *
 * A DataWriter is bound to exactly one Topic and therefore to exactly one data
 * type. The Topic must exist prior to the DataWriter's creation.
 * DataWriter is an abstract class. It must be specialized for each particular
 * application data type. For a fictional application data type Bar (defined in the
 * module Foo) the specialized class would be dds::pub::DataWriter<Foo::Bar>.
 *
 * The pre-processor generates from IDL type descriptions the application
 * DataWriter<type> classes. For each application data type that is used as Topic
 * data type, a typed class DataWriter<type> is derived from the AnyDataWriter
 * class.
 *
 * For instance, for an application, the definitions are located in the Foo.idl file.
 * The pre-processor will generate a ccpp_Foo.h include file.
 *
 * <b>General note:</b> The name ccpp_Foo.h is derived from the IDL file Foo.idl,
 * that defines Foo::Bar, for all relevant DataWriter<Foo::Bar> operations.
 *
 * @note Apart from idl files, Google protocol buffers are also supported. For the
 *       API itself, it doesn't matter if the type header files were generated from
 *       idl or protocol buffers. The resulting API usage and includes remain the same.
 *
 * @code{.cpp}
 * // Default creation of a DataWriter
 * dds::domain::DomainParticipant participant(org::opensplice::domain::default_id());
 * dds::topic::Topic<Foo::Bar> topic(participant, "TopicName");
 * dds::pub::Publisher publisher(participant);
 * dds::pub::DataWriter<Foo::Bar> writer(publisher, topic);

     *
     * <i>QoS</i><br>
     * A possible application pattern to construct the DataWriterQos for the
     * DataWriter is to:
     * @code{.cpp}
     * // 1) Retrieve the QosPolicy settings on the associated Topic
     * dds::topic::qos::TopicQos topicQos = topic.qos();

     * // 3) Combine those two lists of QosPolicy settings by overwriting DataWriterQos
     * //    policies that are also present TopicQos
     * writerQos = topicQos;
     * // 4) Selectively modify QosPolicy settings as desired.
     * writerQos << dds::core::policy::WriterDataLifecycle::ManuallyDisposeUnregisteredInstances();
     * // 5) Use the resulting QoS to construct the DataWriter.
     * dds::pub::DataWriter<Foo::Bar> writer(publisher, topic, writerQos);
     * @endcode
     *
     * <i>Restictions on QoS policies<i>
     * For a coherent writer there exists a constraint on the setting of the History QoS policy.
     * When a writer is created with publisher that has a presentation QosPolicy with
     * coherent_access enabled and where the access_scope is either TOPIC or GROUP
     * then the History QoS policy of the coherent writer should be set to KEEP_ALL.
     * Applying this constraint is necessary because in case of a keep-last writer the
     * samples in the writers history could be pushed out by a new sample which causes that
     * the transaction would not become complete.
     *
     * <i>Implicit Publisher</i><br>
     * It is expected to provide a Publisher when creating a DataWriter. However, it is
     * allowed to provide dds::core::null. When dds::core::null is provided, then an implicit
     * Publisher is created with a default QoS and the DomainParticipant from the provided

     *
     * <i>Listener</i><br>

     *  - dds::core::status::StatusMask::offered_deadline_missed()

     *
     * The explicit use of this operation is optional as the application can directly call the
     * write, unregister_instance or dispose_instance operations without InstanceHandle,
     * which indicate that the sample should be examined to identify the instance.

     * purpose of the @ref dds::pub::DataWriter::dispose_instance(const T& key) "dispose".
     * This operation just indicates that the DataWriter no longer
     * has “anything to say” about the instance. If there is no other DataWriter that

     * This operation attaches a DataWriterListener to the DataWriter. Only one
     * DataWriterListener can be attached to each DataWriter. If a
     * DataWriterListener was already attached, the operation will replace it with the
     * new one. When the listener is the NULL pointer, it represents a listener that is
     * treated as a NOOP for all statuses activated in the bit mask.
     *
     * Listener un-registration is performed by setting the listener to NULL and mask none().
     *
     * @anchor anchor_dds_pub_datawriter_commstatus
     * <i>Communication Status</i><br>
     * For each communication status, the StatusChangedFlag flag is initially set to
     * FALSE. It becomes TRUE whenever that communication status changes. For each
     * communication status activated in the mask, the associated DataWriterListener
     * operation is invoked and the communication status is reset to FALSE, as the listener
     * implicitly accesses the status which is passed as a parameter to that operation. The
     * status is reset prior to calling the listener, so if the application calls the
     * get_<status_name>_status from inside the listener it will see the status
     * already reset. An exception to this rule is the NULL listener, which does not reset the
     * communication statuses for which it is invoked.
     *
     * The following statuses are applicable to the DataWriterListener:
     *  - dds::core::status::StatusMask::offered_deadline_missed()
     *  - dds::core::status::StatusMask::offered_incompatible_qos()
     *  - dds::core::status::StatusMask::liveliness_lost()
     *  - dds::core::status::StatusMask::publication_matched()
     *
     * Be aware that the PUBLICATION_MATCHED_STATUS is not applicable when the
     * infrastructure does not have the information available to determine connectivity.
     * This is the case when OpenSplice is configured not to maintain discovery
     * information in the Networking Service. (See the description for the
     * NetworkingService/Discovery/enabled property in the Deployment
     * Manual for more information about this subject.) In this case the operation will
     * throw UnsupportedError.
     *
     * Status bits are declared as a constant and can be used by the application in an OR
     * operation to create a tailored mask. The special constant dds::core::status::StatusMask::none()
     * can be used to indicate that the created entity should not respond to any of its available
     * statuses. The DDS will therefore attempt to propagate these statuses to its factory.
     * The special constant dds::core::status::StatusMask::all() can be used to select all applicable
     * statuses specified in the “Data Distribution Service for Real-time Systems Version
     * 1.2” specification which are applicable to the PublisherListener.
     *
     * @anchor anchor_dds_pub_datawriter_commpropagation
     * <i>Status Propagation</i><br>
     * In case a communication status is not activated in the mask of the
     * DataWriterListener, the PublisherListener of the containing Publisher
     * is invoked (if attached and activated for the status that occurred). This allows the
     * application to set a default behaviour in the PublisherListener of the containing
     * Publisher and a DataWriter specific behaviour when needed. In case the
     * communication status is not activated in the mask of the PublisherListener as
     * well, the communication status will be propagated to the
     * DomainParticipantListener of the containing DomainParticipant. In case
     * the DomainParticipantListener is also not attached or the communication
     * status is not activated in its mask, the application is not notified of the change.
