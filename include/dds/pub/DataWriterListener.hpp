/**
 *  * @brief
 * DataWriter events Listener
 *
 * Since a DataWriter is an Entity, it has the ability to have a Listener
 * associated with it. In this case, the associated Listener should be of type
 * DataWriterListener. This interface must be implemented by the
 * application. A user-defined class must be provided by the application which must
 * extend from the DataWriterListener class.
 *
 * <b><i>
 * All operations for this interface must be implemented in the user-defined class, it is
 * up to the application whether an operation is empty or contains some functionality.
 * </i></b>
 *
 * The DataWriterListener provides a generic mechanism (actually a
 * callback function) for the Data Distribution Service to notify the application of
 * relevant asynchronous status change events, such as a missed deadline, violation of
 * a QosPolicy setting, etc. The DataWriterListener is related to
 * changes in communication status StatusConditions.
 *

 * // Application example listener
 * class ExampleListener :
 *                public virtual dds::pub::DataWriterListener<Foo::Bar>
 * {
 * public:
