/**
 * @brief
 * Class for RAII way of suspending/resuming publication.
 *
 * Suspended publication indicates to the Service that the application is about
 * to make multiple modifications using DataWriter objects belonging to
 * the Publisher.
 *
 * It is a hint to the Service so it can optimize its performance by,
 * e.g., holding the dissemination of the modifications and then batching
 * them. It is not required that the Service use this hint in any way.
 *
 * When a Suspended publication is started, it must be matched by
 * a corresponding call to SuspendedPublication::resume() or the destruction
 * of the SuspendedPublication object (which is an implicit resume),
 * indicating that the set of modifications has
 * completed. If the Publisher is deleted before the resume,
 * any suspended updates yet to be published will be discarded.
 *
 * This object suspends the publication of all DataWriter objects contained by
 * the given Publisher. The data written, disposed or unregistered by a DataWriter is
 * stored in the history buffer of the DataWriter and therefore, depending on its QoS
 * settings, the following operations may block (see the operation descriptions for
 * more information):
 * - dds::pub::DataWriter.write (and its overloaded counterparts).
 * - dds::pub::DataWriter.operator<< (and its overloaded counterparts).
 * - dds::pub::DataWriter.unregister_instance (and its overloaded counterparts).
 * - dds::pub::DataWriter.dispose_instance (and its overloaded counterparts).
 *
 * @see @ref DCPS_Modules_Publication "Publication"
