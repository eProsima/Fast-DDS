 *
 * DataReaders are created type specific (fi DataReader<Foo::Bar> reader). However, there
 * are many places in the API (and possibly application) where the type can not be known
 * while still some DataReader has to be passed around, stored or even typeless functionality
 * called.<br>
 * Main examples in the API that need typeless DataReader are: Subscriber, SubscriberListener
 * and DomainParticipantListener.

     * objects which have a VOLATILE dds::core::policy::Durability QosPolicy.

     * written prior to the time the DataReader joined the domain, as well as any new

     * logic may require the application to wait until all “historical” data is received. This
     * is the purpose of the wait_for_historical_data operation.
     *
     * As soon as an application enables a VOLATILE DataReader it
     * will not start receiving “historical” data but only new data written by the
     * DataWriter objects. By calling wait_for_historical_data the DataReader
     * explicitly requests the Data Distribution Service to start receiving also the
     * “historical” data and to wait until either all “historical” data is received, or the

     * first.

     * all “historical” data is received, or the duration specified by the max_wait
     * parameter elapses, whichever happens first. When the function returns normally,
     * indicates that all the “historical” data was received. If the function throws
