/**
 * @brief
 * Class to hold sample Rank information and is part of dds::sub::SampleInfo.
 *
 * The sample_rank and generation_rank available in dds::sub::Rank are
 * computed based solely on the actual samples in the ordered collection
 * returned by read or take.
 * - The sample_rank indicates the number of samples of the same instance
 *   that follow the current one in the collection.
 * - The generation_rank indicates the difference
 *   in 'generations' between the sample (S) and the Most Recent Sample of the
 *   same instance that appears In the returned Collection (MRSIC). That is, it
 *   counts the number of times the instance transitioned from not-alive to
 *   alive in the time from the reception of the S to the reception of MRSIC.
 *
 * The generation_rank is computed using the formula:<br>
 * generation_rank =
 *      (MRSIC.disposed_generation_count + MRSIC.no_writers_generation_count) -
 *      (S.disposed_generation_count + S.no_writers_generation_count)
 *
 * The absolute_generation_rank indicates the
 * difference in 'generations' between the sample (S) and the Most Recent
 * Sample of the same instance that the middleware has received (MRS). That is,
 * it counts the number of times the instance transitioned from not-alive to
 * alive in the time from the reception of the S to the time when the read or
 * take was called.
 *
 * The absolute_generation_rank is computed using the formula:<br>
 * absolute_generation_rank =
 *      (MRS.disposed_generation_count + MRS.no_writers_generation_count) -
 *      (S.disposed_generation_count + S.no_writers_generation_count)
 *
 * @see @ref DCPS_Modules_Subscription_SampleInfo "SampleInfo" for more information
