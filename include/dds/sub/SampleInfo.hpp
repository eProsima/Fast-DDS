/**
 * @brief
 * The SampleInfo contains information pertaining to the associated Data value.
 *
 * The SampleInfo contains information pertaining to the associated Data value:
 * - The data state (dds::sub::status::DataState).
 *      - The sample_state of the Data value (i.e., if the sample has already been READ or NOT_READ by that same DataReader).
 *      - The view_state of the related instance (i.e., if the instance is NEW, or NOT_NEW for that DataReader).
 *      - The instance_state of the related instance (i.e., if the instance is ALIVE, NOT_ALIVE_DISPOSED, or NOT_ALIVE_NO_WRITERS).
 * - The valid data flag. This flag indicates whether there is data associated with the sample. Some samples do not contain data indicating only a change on the instance_state of the corresponding instance.
 * - The generation counts (dds::sub::GenerationCount) for the related instance at the time the sample was received. These counters indicate the number of times the instance had become ALIVE.
 *      - The disposed generation count
 *      - The no_writer generation count
 * - The rank information (dds::sub::Rank).
 *      - The sample rank. This rank provides a preview of the samples that follow within the sequence returned by the read or take operations.
 *      - The generation rank. This rank provides a preview of the samples that follow within the sequence returned by the read or take operations.
 *      - The absolute_generation rank. This is the timestamp provided by the DataWriter at the time the sample was produced.
 * - The source timestamp of the sample. This is the timestamp provided by the DataWriter at the time the sample was produced.
 * - The InstanceHandle of the associated data Sample.
 * - The InstanceHandle of the associated publication.
 *
 * @see @ref DCPS_Modules_Subscription_SampleInfo "SampleInfo" for more information
