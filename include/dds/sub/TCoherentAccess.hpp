/**
 * @brief
 * Class for RAII way of beginning/ending coherent access.
 *
 * Coherent access indicates that the application is about to access
 * the data samples in any of the DataReader objects attached to the
 * Subscriber.
 *
 * The application is required to use this operation
 * only if Presentation QosPolicy of the Subscriber to which the
 * DataReader belongs has the access_scope set to "GROUP". In the
 * aforementioned case, the operation must be called
 * prior to calling any of the sample-accessing operations, i.e.
 * read and take on DataReader. Otherwise the sample-accessing
 * operations will throw a PreconditionNotMetError exception.
 *
 * Once the application has finished accessing the data samples
 * it must end the coherent access. It is not required for the
 * application to begin or end access if the Presentation QosPolicy
 * has the access_scope set to something other than GROUP. Beginning
 * or ending access in this case is not considered an error and has
 * no effect. Beginning and ending access may be nested. In that
 * case, the application end access as many times as it began
 * access.
