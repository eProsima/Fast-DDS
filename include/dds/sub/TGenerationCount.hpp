/**
 * @brief
 * Class to hold sample GenerationCount information and is part of dds::sub::SampleInfo.
 *
 * Generations
 * A generation is defined as: ‘the number of times an instance has become alive (with
 * instance_state==ALIVE) at the time the sample was
 * received’. Note that the generation counters are initialized to zero when a
 * DataReader first detects a never-seen-before instance.
 *
 * For each instance the middleware internally maintains two counts: the
 * disposed_generation_count and no_writers_generation_count, relative to
 * each DataReader:
 *
 * Two types of generations are distinguished: disposed_generation_count and
 * no_writers_generation_count.<br>
 * - The disposed_generation_count and no_writers_generation_count are
 *   initialized to zero when the DataReader first detects the presence of
 *   a never-seen-before instance.
 * - The disposed_generation_count is incremented each time the instance_state
 *   of the corresponding instance changes from not_alive_disposed to alive.
 * - The no_writers_generation_count is incremented each time the instance_state
 *   of the corresponding instance changes from not_alive_no_writers to alive.
 *
 * The disposed_generation_count and no_writers_generation_count associated with
 * the SampleInfo capture a snapshot of the corresponding counters at the time
 * the sample was received.
 *
 * @see @ref DCPS_Modules_Subscription_SampleInfo "SampleInfo" for more information
