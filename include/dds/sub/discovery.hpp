/**
 * This operation retrieves the list of publications currently "associated" with the
 * DataReader. That is, subscriptions that have a matching Topic and compatible
 * QoS that the application has not indicated should be “ignored” by means of the
 * ignore_publication operation on the DomainParticipant.
 *
 * The handles returned in the dds::core::InstanceHandleSeq are the ones that are
 * used by the DDS implementation to locally identify the corresponding matched
 * DataWriter entities. You can access more detailed information about a particular
 * publication by passing its publication_handle to either the
 * dds::sub::matched_publication_data operation or to the read with instance
 * operation on the built-in reader for the “DCPSPublication” topic.
 *
 * @note Be aware that since InstanceHandle_t is an opaque datatype, it does not
 * necessarily mean that the handles obtained from the
 * get_matched_publications operation have the same value as the ones that
 * appear in the instance_handle field of the SampleInfo when retrieving the
 * publication info through corresponding "DCPSPublications" built-in reader. You
 * can’t just compare two handles to determine whether they represent the same
 * publication. If you want to know whether two handles actually do represent the
 * same publication, use both handles to retrieve their corresponding
 * PublicationBuiltinTopicData samples and then compare the key field of
 * both samples.
 *
 * The operation may fail if the infrastructure does not locally maintain the
 * connectivity information. This is the case when OpenSplice is configured not to
 * maintain discovery information in the Networking Service. (See the description for
 * the NetworkingService/Discovery/enabled property in the Deployment
 * Manual for more information about this subject.) In such cases the operation will
 * throw UnsupportedError.
 *
 * See @ref DCPS_Builtin_Topics "Builtin Topics" for more information.
