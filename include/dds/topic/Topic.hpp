/**
 * @brief
 * Topic is the most basic description of the data to be published and
 * subscribed.
 *
 * A Topic is identified by its name, which must be unique in the whole Domain.
 * In addition (by virtue of extending TopicDescription) it fully specifies the
 * type of the data that can be communicated when publishing or subscribing to
 * the Topic.
 *
 * Topic is the only TopicDescription that can be used for publications and
 * therefore associated with a DataWriter.
 *
 * <b><i>Example</i></b>
 * @code{.cpp}
 * // Default creation of a Topic
 * dds::domain::DomainParticipant participant(org::opensplice::domain::default_id());
 * dds::topic::Topic<Foo::Bar> topic(participant, "TopicName");
 *
 * // The Topic can be used to create readers and writers
 * // DataReader
 * dds::sub::Subscriber subscriber(participant);
 * dds::sub::DataReader<Foo::Bar> reader(subscriber, topic);
 * // DataWriter
 * dds::pub::Publisher publisher(participant);
 * dds::pub::DataWriter<Foo::Bar> writer(publisher, topic);

     * communication status activated in the mask, the associated TopicListener
     * operation is invoked and the communication status is reset to FALSE, as the listener
     * implicitly accesses the status which is passed as a parameter to that operation. The
     * status is reset prior to calling the listener, so if the application calls the
     * get_<status_name>_status from inside the listener it will see the status
     * already reset. An exception to this rule is the NULL listener, which does not reset the
     * communication statuses for which it is invoked.

     *
     * Status bits are declared as a constant and can be used by the application in an OR
     * operation to create a tailored mask. The special constant dds::core::status::StatusMask::none()
     * can be used to indicate that the created entity should not respond to any of its available
     * statuses. The DDS will therefore attempt to propagate these statuses to its factory.
     * The special constant dds::core::status::StatusMask::all() can be used to select all applicable
