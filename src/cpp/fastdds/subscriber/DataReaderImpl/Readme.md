## Internal support classes for DataReaderImpl

This folder contains the declaration of several internal support classes to improve
maintenance and readability of the DataReaderImpl class.

They are not meant to be used outside DataReaderImpl and their functionality should be
fully covered by the unit tests of the DataReader(Impl).
